I created this website as a way to express myself and show all of the work I have achieved. I have always enjoyed a challenge along with taking the oppertunity to learn a new skill when I can. Thus when deciding what to use to create this site in I choose to devlop my web development skills by learning React and Bootstrap. Along with this I have taken up a hobby of pixel art and believe this site would be a perfect way to express and therefore all assessts are hand drawn.

This project has devloped many of my skills as well as gaining new ones. The first being as the project progressed I know that my CSS skills and ability have also progressed. A new skill I have acquired is understanding and using API's. Before this project I had no expereince with them, however currently I am training for a triathlon and wanted to show my progress using the Strava API. Secondly I knew I wanted a contact me page on my site and I thought that using EmailJS would be the perfect oppertunity for this.

Overall I have had fun learning how React and Bootstrap work together btu mostly I am proud of the work I have produced and believe that it represents me.
